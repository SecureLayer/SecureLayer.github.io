Terms of Service

Effective date: December 28, 2025

1. Acceptance of Terms  
By accessing or using this website (the “Site”), you agree to these Terms of Service and any referenced policies. If you do not agree, do not use the Site.

2. Use of the Site  
You may use the Site for lawful purposes only. You must not misuse the Site, attempt unauthorized access, interfere with operations, or introduce malicious code.

3. Accounts and Contributions  
If you create an account or submit content (issues, PRs, comments, contact messages), you are responsible for maintaining its confidentiality. By submitting content you grant the company a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, and distribute that content in connection with the Site and associated projects. Do not submit confidential or personal data you do not have the right to share.

4. Intellectual Property  
All Site content (text, graphics, logos, templates, code, documentation) is owned by the company or licensed to it, unless explicitly marked otherwise. You may use publicly released assets under any license stated in the repository (e.g., MIT, Apache). Trademarks remain the company’s property.

5. Third-Party Services and Links  
The Site may link to or integrate third-party services. Those services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies. The company is not responsible for third-party content, availability, or practices.

6. Disclaimers and No Warranties  
The Site and its content are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind. The company does not warrant that the Site is uninterrupted, error-free, secure, or free of viruses. No advice or information on the Site creates any warranty.

7. Limitation of Liability  
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the company and its officers, employees, contractors, and partners are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Site, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. The company’s aggregate liability for direct damages is limited to the amount you have paid, if any, in the 12 months preceding the claim, or USD 100 if none.

8. Indemnification  
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the company from claims, liabilities, losses, damages, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of your use of the Site, your violation of these Terms, or your submission of content.

9. Acceptable Use and Prohibited Content  
Prohibited activities include posting illegal content, infringing intellectual property, transmitting malware, scraping data beyond provided APIs, harassing others, or attempting to reverse-engineer protected systems. The company may remove content or suspend access that violates these Terms or is otherwise harmful.

10. Refunds and Payments  
If paid products or services are offered, payment terms, billing, and refund policies will be provided on the relevant purchase page or invoice.

11. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution  
These Terms are governed by the laws of the company’s place of incorporation, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Disputes will be resolved in the competent courts of that jurisdiction unless the parties agree to arbitration.

12. Changes to Terms  
The company may update these Terms. Material changes will be posted with a new effective date. Continued use of the Site after changes constitutes acceptance.

13. Termination  
The company may suspend or terminate access to the Site at any time for any reason, with or without notice. Sections that by their nature survive termination (e.g., Intellectual Property, Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification) will remain in effect.

14. Contact Information  
For questions about these Terms, contact: legal@securelayer.co

15. Entire Agreement  
These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other referenced policies, constitute the entire agreement between you and the company regarding the Site.
